      <h2 class="legal-section-title">1. Grant of Rights</h2>
      <p>
        During the Term of this Agreement, Love Brands shall grant to Company a revocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive license and right to use, reproduce, copy, display, exhibit, print, advertise, publish, publicly or otherwise, whether alone or in combination with other materials (including but not limited to text, data, images, photographs, illustrations, and graphics) in any advertising, promotion, publicity or merchandising, in any and all languages, formats, and media, including internet and digital media, now known and later devised.

      <h2 class="legal-section-title">2. Minimum Advertised Pricing Policy (MAP)</h2>
      <p>
        Love Brands has established a Minimum Advertised Price ("MAP") Policy in order to protect the investment of our resellers and to protect Love Brands brand reputation for quality products. It is recognized that Company invests time and resources to deliver an extraordinary customer experience through knowledgeable staff, product education and compelling product representation. Love Brands has established this MAP Policy to allow Company to earn fair and reasonable profits necessary to maintain the high level of customer excellence which end users expect from Love Brands resellers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MAP Policy applies only to advertised prices and does not apply to the prices at which the products are actually sold by Company. Company remains free at all times to set their own resale prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love Brands will regularly review all Company ecommerce sites and conduct web searches on internet websites to ensure consistent compliance to this MAP Policy. Love Brands intends to cease business with Companies who compromise the perceived value of Love Brands products. If Company chooses to NOT follow the MAP Policy, Love Brands may unilaterally impose sanctions at Love Brands sole discretion. Love Brands intent is to unilaterally refuse to sell products to the Company, if Company intentionally or repeatedly fails to abide by the MAP Policy as described below.
      </p>

      <h3 class="legal-subtitle">Love Brands MAP Policy is defined as follows:</h3>

      <p><strong>a.</strong> Love Brands reserves the right, in its unilateral discretion, to take action with respect to Company violating the following MAP Policy.</p>

      <p><strong>b.</strong> Company must not advertise Love Brands products below the MAP Retail Price. The MAP Retail price is defined as two (2) times the wholesale price listed in the Love Brands Wholesale Order Form. Listing or displaying a price lower than the MAP Retail Price next to the featured product in any advertising will be viewed as a violation of MAP Policy.</p>
      <p>The MAP Policy applies to all advertisement of products in any and all media, including, without limitation: flyers, posters, coupons, mailers, inserts, newspapers, magazines, catalogs, mail order catalogs, internet or similar electronic media including websites, forums, email newsletters, email solicitations, television, radio, and public signage.</p>
      <p>Such website features as "Click for price", automated "bounce-back" pricing e-mails, pre-formatted e-mail responses, forms, automatic price display for any items prior to being placed in an end-user's electronic shopping cart, and other similar features are considered to be advertisements by the Company under this MAP Policy. The MAP Policy also applies to any activity which Love Brands determines, in its sole discretion, is designed or intended to circumvent the intent of the MAP Policy, such as, but not limited to, solicitations for 'group purchases' and similar activities. The MAP policy is not applicable to any in-store advertising that is not distributed to the customer. Pricing listed on an internet site is considered an "advertised price" and must adhere to the MAP policy.</p>

      <p><strong>c.</strong> It shall not be a violation of this MAP Policy to advertise in general that the Company has "the lowest prices" or will match or beat its competitors' prices, or to use similar phrases; as long as Company does not include any advertised price below the MAP Retail Price and Company otherwise complies with this MAP Policy.</p>

      <p><strong>d.</strong> Where Company creates a bundle or package that includes Love Brands products, Company must not sell or advertise the bundle (or package) at a price that: (i) reduces the advertised price of the bundle (or package) to more than 25% below the total MAP Retail Price of the individual products in the bundle (or package) or (ii) violates the letter or spirit of the MAP Policy.</p>

      <p><strong>e.</strong> The value of any Additional Incentives must not (i) reduce the total advertised value of the Love Brands products (including the Additional Incentives) to more than 25% below the total MAP Retail Price of the individual product (where an "Additional Incentive" is defined as any additional discount, coupon, gift card, or incentive in the form of a special event or promotions) or (ii) violate the letter or spirit of the MAP Policy.</p>

      <p><strong>f.</strong> It shall not be a violation of this MAP Policy to advertise that an end-user may "call for price" or "email for price", or to use similar language, specifically with respect to products, so long as no price is listed.</p>

      <p><strong>g.</strong> Company may offer products on promotion at a lower advertised discount only with written permission from Love Brands CEO.</p>

      <p><strong>h.</strong> If Company has multiple ecommerce sites or store locations and violates this MAP Policy at any particular location, then Love Brands will consider this to be a violation by all of Company's locations.</p>

      <p><strong>i.</strong> Although Company remains free to establish its own resale prices, Love Brands reserves the unilateral right to cancel all orders and indefinitely refuse to accept any new orders from Company if Love Brands verifies that Company has advertised any products at a price less than the applicable MAP Retail Price, or if Company has violated this policy in any other way.</p>

      <p><strong>j.</strong> From time to time, Love Brands may discontinue specific products or engage in promotions with respect to certain specified products, or engage in the sale of "close out" products. In such events, Love Brands reserves the right to modify or suspend the MAP policy with respect to the affected products by notifying the Company of such change. Love Brands further reserves the right to unilaterally adjust the MAP with respect to all or certain products at its sole discretion upon ten (10) business days advance notice.</p>
