      <h2 class="legal-section-title">How Is My Subscription Fulfilled?</h2>
      <p>
        Upon checkout, if you choose a "subscription" purchase, rather than a "one-time" purchase, then we will deliver on intervals determined by the customer. The frequency of subscription-based deliveries will be determined by the customer (Available options: 1-month, 2-months, 3-months).
      </p>
      <p>
        A customer can choose to adjust the frequency of their delivery or cancel their subscription at any time through our website or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@lovepaks.com">support@lovepaks.com</a> with a customer request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orders cannot be canceled or adjusted once the order has been "released for shipment". The customer will be notified via email once the order has been "released for shipment". In the event there is an address issue, Love Brands Products will send an email with order details and clarification request to the customer. In this scenario, there may be a delay in shipment.
